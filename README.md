# Computer-Architecture-MIPS-Project
In this project we designed and implemented a program that converts MIPS assembly instructions into machine code, and emulates its execution.

The program  enables the user to trace the code execution line by line.
The instruction set that is implemented includes:
o Arithmetic operations: ADD, ADDI, SUB,
o Logic operations: AND, ANDI, OR, ORI, NOR, SLL, SRL, SRA
o Compare instructions: STL, SLTI
o Move instructions: LUI
o Load and store: LW, SW
o Branch instruction: BEQ, BNE, J
